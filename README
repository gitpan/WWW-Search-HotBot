========== IMPORTANT NOTICE ==========

As of 2001-10-25, www.hotbot.com is broken as follows:
When you click the "next" link on the results page,
it returns the same set of results all over again.
Therefore, this release of WWW::Search::HotBot can only retrieve the first 100 hits
(10 hits when calling gui_query).

========== end of IMPORTANT NOTICE ==========

This is a backend for use with the WWW::Search module.

Please read the README for WWW::Search for general information.

(One place to find it is

)

Read the ChangeLog file in this distribution to see what is new with
this backend since the previous release.
